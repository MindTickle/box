status
=====
Currently this box client is early alpha. Most type signatures not relating to file uploads/downloads can be considered _mostly_ stable (but I make no promises). I hope to get most of this ironed out and to get it fairly stable.

pull requests

Obviously, pull requests are welcome - however, until I get this client to a point that I'm acceptably happy with, I probably wont accept too many. Having said that, I foresee this being "stable enough" soon.

Also, I would love to get feedback of anyone use this package. Since this is an alpha package, I am more than open to being convinced to change certain design choices I've made.
